# Onboarding

Getting started with Qash is quick and easy. This guide will walk you through the entire onboarding process, from creating your account to setting up your company profile.

## Overview

The onboarding process consists of two main steps:

1. **Authentication** - Sign in with your email and get your wallet automatically created
2. **Company Setup** - Provide your company information to enable invoice handling and payment features

## Step 1: Sign In with Email

To get started with Qash, you'll need to authenticate using your email address.

### How It Works

When you sign in with your email, Qash automatically creates a secure wallet for you powered by **[Para](https://www.getpara.com/)**. This means:

- ✅ No need to install browser extensions or manage seed phrases
- ✅ Your wallet is automatically generated and secured
- ✅ You can start using Qash immediately after authentication

After successful authentication, you'll be automatically redirected to the onboarding flow if you don't have a company set up yet.

## Step 2: Company Information
