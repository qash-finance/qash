# What is Qash

Qash is a neobank for global teams to run payroll, earn yield, and spend across chains and currencies while preserving on-chain privacy. It allows companies to pay their team through payroll or handle client invoicing regardless of which chain and currency they are using. Earn stable yield for idle funds and spend funds with corporate cards for team members on business trips—all in one dashboard.

## Why Qash?

### On-chain privacy

Blockchain transparency adds extra time costs to Web3 companies running payroll, where data reveals who was paid, how much, and when, forcing teams to rely on CEXs. Instead, they can manage everything in Qash, which also serves as an all-in-one platform for Web3 companies, offering lightweight accounting, tax calculation, and more.

### All in one financial platform

We remove the operational friction that crypto companies currently face by relying on fragmented tools (Safe + Excel + CEX) and managing multiple wallets across chains.

### Cross chain payout

Qash allows you to pay your team on any chain (EVM, Starknet, Solana, etc.) without manual bridging or handling multiple wallets across multiple chains.

### Simple onboarding

Qash is integrated with AI, allowing you to upload your current setup and spreadsheets. The AI will help you set up your payroll and client contacts, removing the friction of migrating to a new product.

### Integrated with third-party applications

You will receive real-time notifications on your daily applications like Slack, receiving reminders such as when the next payroll is coming, when you've received a new invoice from a client, or when someone from the team spends the team treasury via corporate cards.

### Corporate credit card

Handling reimbursements, especially for Web3 companies, is a nightmare, from currency conversion to collecting receipts and reimbursing in crypto. With corporate credit cards, you can let your team members spend with rules and limits, and pay at the end of the month together with payroll.
